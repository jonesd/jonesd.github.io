<TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.03 oct08<TD><UL>
	<LI>Detect object in Galaxy window under pointer. Works in all (?) modes and 				magnifications</UL>
<TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.04 oct10<TD><UL>
	<LI>Transformed GalaxyPane into a nice little pane. Attached to left hand side of Galaxy. 	Redirected all window_open*, and window_close* to be redirected through *WindowRequest, as 	used by WimpPoll.
	<LI>Changed from !Messages to Messages, hmpph.
	<LI>Added record of PollMask.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.05 oct11<TD><UL>
	<LI>Started System & Star. Open System with star (simple) when click over Galaxy window.
	<LI>Made openWindowRequest, closeWindowRequest call out to specific routines depending on 	window handle. Same with mouseClick.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.06 oct11<TD><UL>
	<LI>Created window_openPane - feed it block of offsets for pane.
	<LI>Created icon_writeName, so sorted out some icon problems.
	<LI>StarSystem generation works ok.
	<LI>Set new astronomical objects to 25% BlackHole, 75% StarSystem.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.07 oct15<TD><UL>
	<LI>Speeded up galaxy redraw by precalculating some class redraw details.
	<LI>Primitive showing of Introduction window before main game is set up.

</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.08 oct16<TD><UL>
	<LI>window_openCentred works ok now.
	<LI>Redesigned Intro window. Use slider for density. Number of objects/
        density linked with rest of program. Updates area nicely.
	<LI>Better integration of Intro in app startup sequence.
	<LI>Bugfixed icon_writeName (name length). Also terminate maximum length
        names. Use ForceRedraw to reduce flicker. Forget border redraw.
        If R7 first validation, grow border so text icons don't flash soo much.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.09 oct18<TD><UL>
	<LI>Density slider now works nice. Dragable.
	<LI>Redid redrawRequest to better handle multiple windows.
	<LI>Recoded galaxy_nearestObject. Super fast. Well no longer FPA

	<LI>Developing standard Interface Object connection details. So can just
        plug various IObjects together. Only be informed of any changes at the
        end of the whole thing. Pretty cool stuff.
	<LI>icon_writeName uses UpdateWindow noew, so NO flicker at all. Amazing.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.12 oct31<TD><UL>
	<LI>Created WriteableNumber IO. Defining Interface Objects standards.
	<LI>Reimplemented Magnifier window using IO.
	<LI>Slight heap_getBlock for large sizes solved.

        This dramatically improves redraw with 1000's of objects.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.13 nov02<TD><UL>
	<LI>Uprated galaxy_nearestObject, and astronomical object creation to be
	able to handle HUGE galaxies. Now should work up to the limit of memory
	space.
	<LI>Multitasking while generating galaxy.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.14 nov03<TD><UL>
	<LI>Added percentage value icon to Creating window. Get a better idea of

	<LI>Set up Docs window, connecting !Help within it. Defined What Was, What
        Is, and What Will text entries.
	<LI>Had a problem with a number of windows mistakenly defined as panes.
        Caused problem with setting highlighted window title bar, when we
        should of had it. 
	<LI>Split Galaxy into a number of blocks. Allowing even faster redraw, as
        effort is now more proportional to actual stars to redraw, rather than
        number of stars in galaxy.
	<LI>Updated galaxy_nearestObject to work with blocked Galaxy. Now V.fast
        update however large the galaxy is.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.15 nov10<TD><UL>

        of relevant objects sprite is small enough.
	<LI>Astronomical objects are now named.
	<LI>Added GalaxyAnalysis window, providing information on the physical
        structure of the Galaxy. Looks ok to boot!

	<LI>Solved problem of returning 'illegal' work area coord from pointer.
	<LI>Slightly moved GalaxyPane window left, so it doesn't overlap.
	<LI>Creating window now multitasks in a nicer way, along the lines of a
        TaskWindow so it should only take a percentage of processor time. Never
        sucking up extra time.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.17 nov17<TD><UL>
	<LI>Added beginnings of SymbolsPane window.
	<LI>Pane windows are getting there. Solved problem with WIMP forcing
        position of windows after Opening. Still a problem with first opening.
	<LI>Support for HotKeys.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.18 nov20<TD><UL>

	<LI>Reorganized Register usage so retrieved a premanently sidelined reg.
	Yippee.
	<LI>Ventured into the world of 256 colours. Uglyness greeted me from all
        corners. Should be ok now.
	<LI>Siphoned off ObjectInfo source module.
	<LI>Attempt at silly logo... Well its better than the previous one.
	<LI>Silly logo now reached Info window. This has blown up to medical
        proportions. Lets hope it does not spread.
	<LI>It almost killed me, but !Sprites22 added. Also sm!astrophel icons.
	<LI>Added Mode20 sprites to main sprite file. So icons less raggard when
        magnified in Galaxy window.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.21 nov30<TD><UL>
	<LI>Message_PaletteChange updates internals, also redraws appropriate
	windows.
	<LI>Pane windows now work perfectly. At last. Phew  (Actually no... drat)
	<LI>After a bit of battling have a specific Pinboard icon for Galaxy window.
	<LI>Standard ScrollRequest handler.Used on Galaxy to stop scrolling flicker.
	<LI>icon_writeName checks on CaretPosition, ensuring its within boundary.
        Also only redraws, etc if there is a difference in the string.
	<LI>Symbols shows selected object.
	<LI>Added Creation Efficiency entry in Intro.
	<LI>Galaxy Magnifier improved so last object under pointer stays in centre
        of displayed section of Galaxy window.
	<LI>Due to minimum size of Galaxy window, at high magnifications an illegal
        border was left. This caused problems for galaxy_nearestObject,
        galaxy_redraw. Ok now.
	<LI>Due to annoyance factor, "Astronomical Object" window opens Behind
        main Galaxy window. Rather than right in front...
	<LI>Added grey underneath to Window_Intro shape, so get a better idea of
        what is going on. Added Alter replacement pointer over this area. Seems
        to fit in well with its guidelines for use. Also reduced flicker. Yes!
	<LI>Window_Intro shape. Stopped inconvenience of clicking over the sim.
        window title. This caused a graphic prob, and pointer jump. Not too
        pretty.

	<LI>Sliders now allow no y movement while dragging bar. Same as windows.
	<LI>Intro Creation writeable ignored type values.
	<LI>Changed up to fast Division routine listed by Graeme Williams. Pretty
        useful as this is used a lot in Galaxy redraw...
	<LI>Selected object within Galaxy window flashes, so its easier to spot.
	<LI>Objects can also be dropped over the GalaxyPane.
	<LI>Solved annonying problem of Symbols_Finder. Wrong string terminator
        from Template definition. Aaargh
	<LI>System of grid lines drawn on Galaxy window. Option to switch them
        on and off. Need colour window though...
	<LI>Added little copyright message at bottom of Intro window. Closes after
        20 seconds.
	<LI>Changed capatilization in window titles.
	<LI>One of the Magnifier Ctrl- adjuster values wrong ve.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.24 dec09<TD><UL>
	<LI>Allow Grid line colour to be changed.
	<LI>Added simple Error Handler. So you can continue after an error.
	<LI>Grid lines disappeared at high magnification. Ok now. Don't draw along
        borders now aswell.
	<LI>If Astrophel runs out of memory prompts user to set more, before
        carrying on. Very flaky at moment...
	<LI>Position & size of Copyright window relative to parent Intro window
        calculated from actual window data, rather than constants.

</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.26 apr26<TD><UL>
	<LI>Slightly updated request for extra memory, so it will quit in
	response to system request.
	<LI>Taking over of ErrorHandler now system friendly.
</UL><TR  VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.27 aug12<TD><UL>
	<LI>Makefile reworked.
	<LI>Copyright message integrated within Intro window defn, so only one
        window which shrinks so smoother/cheaper.
