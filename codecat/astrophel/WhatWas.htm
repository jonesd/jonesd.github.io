<P>Before Astrophel there came. <A HREF="../trynth/index.htm">Trynth</A>. A 1st generation desktop Space Strategy Game. Though Astrophel is programmed in a different language, for a different version of RiscOS, and with different ideas in mind, Trynth was an important stepping stone.</P>

<P>This game is inspried by the experiences of writing an earlier Space Strategy Game for the Archimedes, Trynth. This is a desktop game, based around the notion of having a simple underlying system, with the complexity of the game coming from a large number of opposing sides. Up to fifteen sides can be handled, with as many human players as you like, with the rest of the sides filled up by a range of different computer players.</P>

<P>Trynth promoted this structural simplicity, with a good user interface. The playing area consists of a number of 'planets'. Each with a certain level of production. Each turn this prodution increases, and a related number of ships are automatically constructed. There is a single type of ship. Players initially start with one planet. All excess planets all termed neutral, with a random number of defensive ships. To take over a planet, a player sends a number of their ships to the desired planet, and battle commences.</P>

<P>The game contains a number of problems though. Firstly the interface is a little unintuitive at early stages. Also a number of windows could be merged together to reduce the screen real estate needed.</P>

<P>Stronger computer players are needed.</P>

<P>Alliances between sides would be a very important feature, unfortunately that was not implemented.</P>

<P>As a result the game gets boring rather too soon, unless a number of humans are playing. There is scope for improvement.</P>

<P>Trynth is Shareware, though a fully operating version can be obtained from me by sending a 800k disc, and return postage. Registering costs 5 pounds. Hurry you could be the first :-) I am also open to other offers?</P>
