</TABLE>

<P>The resting place of a number of odds and ends that I have programmed in the past, mostly on the Acorn Archimedes. I have supplied the distribution file and have htmled all the existing documentation in a pretty mechanical fashion, I haven't tried to tidy any of it up like I probably should have. I'm no mortician, so if it went out a wreck, that's the way it's stayed.<P>

<P>Browsing over the contents, things certainly seemed to have aged more gracefully in my memory versus the display I have put on.</p>

<p>Regrettably I have also lost a few of my other older projects. Converting <i>Little Smalltalk</i> to RiscOS was probably the largest project I undertook, taking the command line based LST, and adapting it to use the RiscOS windows and make the core libraries/compiler/vm more like Smalltalk-80. I'm sure it would stink if I ever found the damned disk with it on, still I enjoyed it, though not the performance on my machine... A <i>Neural Network</i> simulator with nice programmable UI that I once hoped could struggle on to be a commercial product. No such luck. The last missing program I can remember was a <i>desktop pinboard</i> which you could shrink windows down to icons on, have multiple desktops, etc. The nice feature was that the iconified windows used a shrunk down version of the windows appearance at the time of iconification.</P>
