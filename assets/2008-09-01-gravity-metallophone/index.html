	From the many views of the Eames one of the most beguiling, by its simplicity and
	adroitness, is from their relatives Eames Demetrios and Lucia Eames,
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Films-Charles-Ray-Eames-Powers/dp/6305943877">901: After 45 Years of Working</a>.
	A documentary of the closing of the office at
	910 Washington Boulevard after the death of Ray. It is a first-person ramble
	through the warren of worshops, offices and storage spaces, where every inch
	is bursting with the remants of the hundreds of projects undertaken by the office
	over the years. It is both aspiring and quite humbling.
</p>

<p>
	I was drawn back into this magical world recently when it eventually dawned upon
	me that the tune that I had been incessantly humming lay at the door of the Eames'
	office. Not the hurdy gurdy, but rather the tinking waterfall of the Musical Towers.
	According to the documentaries narrative, a task for new employees of the office
	was to rearrange the tower's tune by altering the configuration of tuned metal
	plates struck by the calvacade of falling marbles. For musical instruments they
	are quite an intimidating sight, taller than a man, the marbles are shot atop by
	the thrust of a pneumatic pump, where they then chime each plate in turn on their
	descent. The pedantic strikes by one marble compound into naturalistic harmonies when
  concurrent marbles are flowing down the steps of the ladder.

<h2>Weekend Prototype</h2>

<p>
	Driven to distraction by the chiming, and with a long holiday weekend at hand, it seemed the only
  remedy would be to build a version of the tower for myself. The short time frame limited the
  materials at hand: for the chimes, a few sets of children's xylophones with colourful metal tubes
  laid out on plastic runners; glass marbles; 5mm black foamcore for the body.
</p>

<p>
  Once the tubes were
  prised away from their frame, an early experiment suggested marbles should roll across them longitudinally,
  rather than across the breadth as in the Tower. This led to a structure of two pillars holding
  alternating tubes set towards each other, with sides completed to form a box to contain the
  marbles. A marble dropped in at the top on one side would roll along the first tube, fall at the end striking the
  tube immediately below it, then roll back towards the original side, where it would fall down
  at the end to the tube below it, and so on until it reached a bucket at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
  The body is composed of three repeating narrow boxes which can be stacked on top of each other, together
  with a bucket at the bottom to hold the fallen marbles. The entire structure slots together and then
  attached to a wall for strength.
