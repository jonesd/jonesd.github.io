<p>Windows 95/98/NT adaptation	of	the Avalon Hill Machiavelli 2nd edition board game. Developed using Dolphin Smalltalk,	
Visual C++ and	DirectX 6.0	over a period of 3 months during 1999.</p>

<p>Multi-user turn	based	strategy	game set	during the Renaissance period. Players	control city states whose ultimate aim	is	to	reunify Italy,	through military and	diplomatic efforts. Based on the	Diplomacy game	with additional factors	of	the age; finances, plagues, famines, assassinations, the	papacy, economics, loans and special units.</p>

<p>The	current version supports all the	basic/advanced/optional	rules	from the	boardgame, hotseat	and network	play,	saving/loading, tutorial, manual, history	of	past actions and game board state and support for alternative scenarios.</p>

<p>If you	are interested	in	developing similar strategy games of your	own please get	in	contact.	I have had a first stab	at	a Dolphin Smalltalk library/framework for	creating	similar games which you	might	find educational.</p>

<p>Originally aimed for commercial release, the adaptation is now consigned	to	private project status.	<strong>Due	to	copyright reasons	the adaptation	is	not publicly	available.</strong> Sorry, but hopefully Hasbro will eventually release an official adaptation.</p>
