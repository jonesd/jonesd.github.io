<p><em>&quot;Machiavelli recreates the balance-of-power struggle
in Renaissance Italy from 1454 to 1529. Machiavelli can be played
by two to eight players (five to six is ideal). Each player
controls a major state of Italy or a neighbouring country and
uses diplomatic and military force to conquer territory and
fulfill the game's victory conditions. If you are power mad,
treacherous by nature and can lie with a straight face, then
Machiavelli is the game for you!&quot; </em></p>

<p>This document describes the UI for the computer adaption, and
quick descriptions of the mechanics of the game. This information is supplied
merely as an overview to my adaptation. If you wish to play the game, go and buy yourself
a copy of the Avalon Hill boardgame, or petition Hasbro for a commercial adaptation of this fine game.</p>
		  <p><i>
		  This adaption has been a	private development,	and is not associated in any way	with Avalon	Hill or Hasbro	Interactive.<br>

<h2><a name="Map Board">Map Board</a></h2>

<p>Once you have started a new game or joined an existing game
you will be presented with the map board. </p>

<p>Covering the entire screen is a section of the scenarios map
board. The board is split up into areas. Land areas are called
provinces. Some provinces also contain cities, shown by a single
solid black circle. Cities may be fortified, in which case the
city is surrounded by a black halo. </p>

<img src="conflict.jpg" width="672" height="487">

<p>Three types of military units may be present on the mapboard.
Army units may only occur in provinces. Garrisons can only occur
in fortified cities. Fleets can be present in either sea areas or
provinces bordering a sea area. </p>

<p>The map board can be scrolled by either moving the mouse
pointer to the edge of the screen, the cursor keys, or right
button dragging. </p>

<p>Along the top edge of the screen you will see the name of the
scenario on the left, and on the right the current phase and turn
number.</p>

<h3><a name="Current Power information">Current Power information</a></h3>

<p>Along the left hand edge of the screen you will see the
controls and readouts associated with the current power. </p>

<p>The power is identified by its coat of arms towards the top
left of the screen, with its name and current treasury total in
ducats, and controlled cities total shown to its right. As well
as a coat of arms, a colour is also associated with the power,
and used to distinguish information associated with the power.
This colour is shown in the border of the coat of arms, and used
by the text to the right of the coat of arms. </p>

<p>Immediately below the coat of arms power related information
specific to the current phase will be shown as you progress
through the game. </p>

<p>Immediately above the coat of arms you will find an icon that
once clicked will open a <a href="#Power Properties">Power
Properties</a> panel for the current power. This describes the
current characteristics and totals for the power, with details of
its controlled areas, and outstanding loans on following tabs. </p>

<p>Games using the Advanced Rules will also contain a transfer
icon, which opens the <a href="#Transfer to Power">Transfer Power</a>
panel allowing you to donate ducats from your treasury, and
assassination units to another power. </p>

<p>Above these controls you will find the Finish button. When you
have finished entering your actions for the current phase,
clicking the Finish button will inform the system that you are
ready to move onto the next phase of the turn. Once all the
players have Finished, the game will move onto the next phase. </p>

<p>Feedback on which powers have already finished is shown in a
thin column to the left of the Finish button. A rectangle filled
with the powers associated colour will be drawn for each finished
power. The tool tip, shown by holding the mouse pointer still
over the control for a second, also displays this information. </p>

<h3><a name="Changing Current Power">Changing Current Power</a></h3>

<p>In a Hotseat game you can change the current power by clicking
on the coat of arms, then choosing the new power once the screen
blanks out. </p>

<p>While all the powers coats of arms are unfurled, the current
power will be lit up brighter than the others. </p>

with Return to select it. </p>

<h3><a name="Game Information">Game Information</a></h3>

<p>Along right edge of the screen you will see game information.
The controls and text shown along the right edge is shown exactly
the same for all players of the game, whereas the controls and
text along the left hand edge of the screen in specific to your
power. </p>

<p>The bulk of the space is set aside for information particular
to the current phase. </p>

<p>At the top of the column you will find a number of icons which
open panels on various behaviour of the game. </p>

<p>The Help icon opens the <a href="#Help">Help</a> panel
containing the program About box, Manual and Rules of Play. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Start a New Game">New Game</a> allows you to
start a new game. </p>

<p>The <a href="#User Interface Options">UI Options</a> icon
opens a panel that allows you to change various UI options that
include screen resolution, use of sound, etc. Each machine in a
network game may independently set their own UI options. </p>

<p><a href="#Open Game">Open</a> and <a href="#Save Game">Save</a>
game icons. </p>

<p><a href="#Scenario Information">Scenario Information</a> which
lists the current scenario criteria, and power standings, past
power actions and a graph of power relative totals. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Chat">Chat</a> panel allows textual
communication between powers. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Quit Scenario">Quit Scenario</a> icon allows you
to abort the current game and return to the <a
href="#Entrance Screen">Entrance Screen</a>. </p>

<p>In the Hotseat game an additional Next button will be added.
This performs the equivalent of each player clicking the Finish
button for their power. It is a purely a speedup for those times
when most/all players do not want to enter any actions during a
phase. </p>

<h3><a name="Listed items">Listed items</a></h3>

<p>Frequently during the course of the game lists of units,
orders and provinces will be displayed along the left and right
edges of the screen. </p>

<p>To refocus the map on the location of the counter or area
associated with listed item, click on the goto icon associated
with the listed item. Additionally if you hold the mouse pointer
still over the goto icon it will pop up some descriptive
information of the item.</p>

<h2><a name="On Starting a Game">On Starting a Game</a></h2>

<p>On starting a new game, or joining one, you will initially be
presented by a welcome panel in the center of the screen which
lists the playing powers with the name of their players. </p>

<p>In the case of a network game, you may have to wait until all
the players join. You will be given feedback as players join. </p>

<p>Once you are ready to start click the Finish button at the top
left of the screen. As soon as all the powers have done likewise
you will move onto the first phase, and the game proper will
start.</p>

<p>The game progresses from one turn to next, until one power
meets the victory conditions specified when the game was being
created. Each turn is composed of a number of phases, each
documented in the following section.</p>

<p>The current turn and phase are shown on the white bar at the
top of the screen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Turn Start Phase"><strong>Turn Start Phase</strong></a></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Victory Panel"><strong>Victory Panel</strong></a></h3>

<p>If a power has won by meeting the <a href="#Victory Condition">Victory

player is declared victorious. </p>

<p>A panel declaring the victor and listing the relative
standings of all the powers is shown. </p>

<p>Players can either continue playing or start a new game. </p>

<img src="victory.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<h3><a name="Start of Turn Panel">Start of Turn Panel</a></h3>

<p>The Start of Turn panel displays a summary for each of the
powers; controlled cities, treasury, total debt, total army
units, total fleet units and total garrisons. </p>

<p>Power summaries are ordered by their success, and the details
for the current power are highlighted.</p>

<img src="startofturn.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<h2><a name="1. Famine Marker Phase">1. Famine Marker Phase</a></h2>

<p>The Famine Marker Phase only occurs during the Spring turn,
and if you checked the <a href="#Natural Disasters">Natural
Disaster</a> when creating the game. </p>

<p>A number of provinces are randomly chosen, and in each a
Famine Marker counter is placed. </p>

<p>All the effected provinces are displayed along the right edge
of the screen, split by the power which controls them, if any. </p>

<p>Provinces controlled by the current power that are effected
are listed along the left edge of the screen. </p>

<p>Then in turn from the top of the board you will see Famine
Marker counters added to each of the effected provinces. </p>

<p>The effects of Famine are only experienced at the end of the
turn, so it may be possible to move your military units to a safe
province. </p>

<p>If no provinces were effected by famine the phase will
automatically advance to the next after a short pause. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="2. Income &amp; Military Unit Adjustment Phase">2.
Income &amp; Military Unit Adjustment Phase</a></h2>

during the Spring turn, except for the first turn. </p>

<h3><a name="Income panel">Income panel</a></h3>

<p>If you checked the <a href="#Advanced Rules">Advanced Rules</a>
option when creating the game, you will be presented with a panel
listing the income in ducats. </p>

<p>The total income is split into income from provinces you
control or have a military unit in, sea areas containing one of
your Fleets, cities you control or have an unbesieged Garrison
in, and variable income from your state, conquered states and
some cities you control. The amount of variable income received
is based on a die roll. All powers variable income is calculated
from the same die roll. </p>

<p>You receive 1 ducat for each named province, except for those
with the actual income listed alongside. </p>

<p>Click OK in the panel once you are finished examining the
information. </p>

<img src="income.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<h3><a name="Military Unit Adjustments">Military Unit Adjustments</a></h3>

<p>Each power secretly decides which military units on the map
board to keep, which to discard, and if any new units are to be
created. </p>

<p>Once all powers have clicked finished, the result of the all
powers adjustments will be unveiled. </p>

<p>The current powers existing military units are listed along
the left edge of the screen. </p>

<p>Clicking over one of your existing units on the map board will
remove it, while clicking over an empty home province or city in
your home area will create a new military unit there. </p>

<p>Units to keep are shown on the map as normal. Units to disband
have a red cross overlaying the counter on the map. Units to

delete is determined by the number of cities you control. </p>

<p>If you have more cities than military units then you can
create up to the difference in new units. You are not allowed to
remove any units. </p>

<p>If you have less cities than military units, then you have to
remove enough military units until the two totals match. You are
not allowed to create any new units. </p>

<h3><a name="Advanced Military Unit Adjustments">Advanced

<p>If you checked the <a href="#Advanced Rules">Advanced Rules</a>
when creating the game, the number of military units you are
allowed on the board is determined by you current treasury. </p>

<p>Each unit has an upkeep cost, which you must pay to stop the
unit from being removed from the board. You can create as many
new units as you can afford, though you are still limited to
creating them in home areas with cities. </p>

<p>All normal units cost 3 ducats a year, whether they are new or
this is upkeep for an existing unit. </p>

<p>You will not be allowed to Finish this phase if your units
will force your treasury into a negative value. </p>

<p>If you checked the <a href="#Special Units">Special Units</a>
when creating the game, you will be allowed to flag one of your
military units as being a <a

</ul>

<p>Powers can be restricted in which special types of units they
can employ. The <a href="#Power Properties">Power Properties</a>
panel lists which types are available. </p>

<p>The type of each unit is indicated along the left edge of the
screen next to the units goto icon. You can change the type for
new units by clicking over its indicator. A tool tip gives
information on the types characteristics. </p>

<p>You can only set the type of a unit when you are creating it,

edge of the screen, split by whether they were added or removed
from the map board. </p>

<p>Then in turn from the top of the board you will see their
counters being added or removed from the board. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="3. Plague Phase">3. Plague Phase</a></h2>

<p>The Plague Phase only occurs during the Summer turn, and if
you checked the <a href="#Natural Disasters">Natural Disaster</a>
when creating the game. </p>

<p>A number of provinces are randomly chosen, and any military
units in the effected provinces are removed from the map board. </p>

<p>All the effected military units are displayed along the right
edge of the screen, split by the power which controlled them. </p>

<p>Military units of the current power effected are listed along
the left edge of the screen. </p>

<p>Then in turn from the top of the board you will see their
counters removed from the board. </p>

<p>If no provinces were effected by plague the phase will
automatically advance to the next after a short pause. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="4. Diplomacy Phase">4. Diplomacy Phase</a></h2>

<p>Diplomacy is the core of Machiavelli, and it is during the
Diplomacy phase that players can split up and devise schemes and
plots with some of the other players in the game. </p>

<h3><a name="Excommunication">Excommunication</a></h3>

<p>If the <a href="#Excommunication">Excommunication</a> optional
rule was checked during the game creation, the player controlling
the Papacy power has the option to excommunicate one of the other
players for the duration of this Diplomacy phase. An
excommunicated power may not communicate with any other power. If
a power communicates with an excommunicated power, they too
become excommunicated for the duration of the Diplomacy phase. </p>

<p>The Papacy power should click the power he would like
excommunicated, then click the Excommunicate button.If the Papacy
power does not wish any power to be excommunicate this turn, then
click the Pass button. </p>

<img src="excommunicate.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<p>All the other powers will be informed of the choice, and
should Finish, before the Diplomacy phase proper starts. </p>

<img src="excommunicated.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<h3><a name="Chatting">Chatting</a></h3>

<p>During the Diplomacy phase you will find that the <a
href="#Chat">Chat</a> panel allows you to select a subset of the
total powers so that you can indulge in private discussions.
Excommunicated powers are indicated by overlaying an
excommunicated marker, and you will be warned before
communicating with an excommunicated power. </p>

<p>You may find it useful to open more than one Chat panel during
this phase to carry on discussions with more than one group of
players at one time. </p>

<p>The Diplomacy phase is time limited, and will force the game
onto the next phase even if some players haven't Finished once
the duration is reached. </p>

<p>The duration is set from the &quot;Game Options&quot; page of
the <a href="#Start a New Game">New Game</a> wizard. You may set
the first Diplomacy phase to be longer in duration than
subsequent phases, as the bulk of alliances are set during the
first turn.</p>

<h2><a name="5. Ducat Borrowing Phase">5. Ducat Borrowing Phase</a></h2>

<p>If the <a href="#Money Lenders">Money Lenders</a> optional
rule was set during game creation then you will be able to borrow
ducats from one of the fantastically wealthy and powerful
international bankers and financiers which arose during the
period. </p>

<p>A power may borrow up to a total of 25 ducats in a series of
one or two year loans. Failure to repay leads to the same effects
as a successful assassination, the power will be refused credit
from then on, but all the existing outstanding loans need not be
paid. </p>

<h3><a name="Repayment">Repayment</a></h3>

<p>First a power must repay any existing loans that are due that
turn. </p>

<p>Click either the <em>Repay</em> to pay the loan with interest
back in full, or <em>Refuse</em> if you refuse to pay the loan,
at which point you will suffer the consequences. </p>

<p>If you have insufficient funds to immediately repay the due
loans, then <em>Refuse</em> will be your only option. At this
stage it is not possible to gain a new loan to cover the demands
of the existing loans. </p>

<p>Future outstanding loans for the power are listed in the lower
half of the panel. For each outstanding loan the original amount,
due date and amount including interest that must be repayed. </p>

<p>If you have no loans to repay, but other powers do, you will
have to wait for them to make their choice before being able to
continue. The coats of arms of those powers you are still waiting
for are listed, any if any power defaults on a loan their coat of
arms will be shown in the next row. </p>

<img src="loansdue.jpg" width="400" height="300">

<h3><a name="Defaulting Effects">Defaulting Effects</a></h3>

<p>If a power refuse to repay a loan, the power suffers the same
effects as if assassinated. </p>

<p>The disbanded units and rebellions for all defaulting powers
are listed along the right edge of the screen, split by power. </p>

<p>Disbanded units and rebellions effecting the current power are
listed along the left edge of the screen. </p>

<p>Each effect in turn will then be indicated on the map board. </p>

<h3><a name="New Loans">New Loans</a></h3>

<p>Every turn you are able to set up both a one year or two year
loan. The two year loan has a higher interest rate. Only a total
of 25 ducats may be borrowed at any one point. </p>

amount borrowed. The amount paid into the powers treasury is
shown first, followed by the due date and then the complete
amount that must be repaid to the money lenders which includes
interest. </p>

<h2><a name="6. Order Writing Phase">6. Order Writing Phase</a></h2>

<p>During the Order Writing Phase you may give a single order for
each of your units. There are six to choose from. You make these
orders in ignorance of the orders the other powers are giving to
their own units. </p>

<p>Once you finish this phase, you will see all the other powers
orders in the Movement and Conflict Phase, and whether your own
orders have been successful. </p>

<h3><a name="Screen Layout">Screen Layout</a></h3>

<p>All of the powers military units are shown along the left
edge. By default they are set to the <a href="#Hold Order">Hold</a>
order. </p>

<p>Positioned to the left of each order is the goto icon.
Clicking on this will scroll the map board to show the units
counter, and highlight its position with a ripple animation.
Additionally if you hold the mouse pointer still over the goto
icon, a textual description of the units order is displayed. </p>

<h3><a name="Setting an Order for a Unit">Setting an Order for a
Unit</a></h3>

<p>To enter a new order for a unit, click with the left mouse
button over the units counter on the map board, drag the counter
to its destination area or city and let go. As you are dragging
the counter you will see an arrow extending from the counters
start position. </p>

<p>Note that the map board will scroll if you mouse pointer is at
an edge while you are dragging a unit. </p>

<p>Only provinces which for which there is a valid order for the
unit will stay visible, all others will be dulled. Ending the drag
over such a dulled province will cancel the order.</p>

<img src="orderrestrictions.jpg" width="236" height="203">

<p>If there is only one valid order you will see that the order
description on the left hand edge of the screen changes to
reflect the new order. </p>

<p>If you move the mouse pointer over the counter on the map
board and hold it still, you will see that a textual description
of the order is shown. This is useful if you cant read the
abbreviated orders. </p>

<p>Sometimes there are more than one valid orders for a unit to
an area. In this case when you drop the counter after dragging
it, the screen will be put in shadows except for the area around
the drop position. Positioned in a circle around the drop point
the choice of legal orders will be shown. The order abbreviation
is shown, coloured by the power of the involved unit. Clicking
over one of the order abbreviations will select that as the new
order for the unit. </p>


<img src="orderchoice.jpg" width="186" height="212">

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#1. Advance/Attack (-)"
name="Advance Order"><strong>Advance Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Order a Fleet or Army to move to an adjacent area. If there is
a unit already in the destination area, or another unit is
attempting to move into the unit, then you unit with superior
support will be one that succeeds. </p>

<p>An Army can move further than an immediately adjacent area if
it can be <a href="#Convoy Order">Convoyed</a> by one or more
Fleets. Both the current province of the army, and the
destination, must be coastal provinces. Each intervening sea area
must have a Fleet which Convoys the Army. If you are missing 1 or
more convoys then a red ?? will be overlayed on the Advance
orders description. </p>

<p>To enter an Advance order, drag the units counter to the
destination area. </p>

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#2. Besiege (B)" name="Besiege Order"><strong>Besiege
Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Orders a Fleet or Army to besiege an enemy held fortified city
in the area which the unit is currently located. The same unit
must besiege for two consecutive turns to be successful. The
garrisons support is immaterial, as they starve at the same rate.
</p>

<p>To enter a Besiege order, drag the units counter to the city
in the same province as the unit. </p>

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#3. Hold (H)" name="Hold Order"><strong>Hold
Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Orders a Fleet, Army or Garrison to remain in place. This is
the default order if the unit is given no other order, or its
order becomes invalid. </p>

<p>To enter a Hold order, drag the units counter over itself. </p>

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#4. Support (S)" name="Support Order"><strong>Support
Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Orders a Fleet, Army or Garrison to support some other unit
carrying out its orders. The Supporting order must have been able
to move to the destination of the supported unit to be valid. The
unit does not move from its location. </p>

<p>To enter a Support order, drag the units counter to the area
or city which the unit you wish to support is advancing to, or
for other orders, is stationed in. </p>

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#5. Convoy (C)" name="Convoy Order"><strong>Convoy
Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Orders a Fleet to convoy an Army with an Advance order through
the sea area it occupies. Once a Convoy order has been
successfully entered you will see that the arrow from the armies
present province to its destination province will be directed
through the Fleets sea. </p>

<p>To enter a Convoy order, drag the units counter to the
province which is the armies destination of its advance order. </p>

<p><a href="rulesofplay.htm#6. Conversion (=)" name="Conversion"><strong>Conversion
Order</strong></a></p>

<p>Orders a Fleet, Army or Garrison unit to change to a unit of a
different type. Conversions can only take place in a province
with a fortified city. An Army can convert into a Garrison, and a
Garrison can convert into an Army or Fleet if the city is a port.
To convert from a Fleet to an Army takes two turns, as you have
to convert into a Garrison first. </p>

<p>To enter a Conversion order, drag the units counter to the
provinces city if its a Fleet or Army, for Garrisons drag the
units counter from the city to its surrounding provinces. </p>

<h3><a name="Orders for other powers">Orders for other powers</a></h3>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to enter supposed orders for units
belonging to other powers. Examples of when this would be useful
are if you will be convoying or supporting a unit belonging to
another power, or you expect to take control of the unit
following a successful <a href="#(K) Buy Enemy Unit Expenditure">Buy
Enemy Unit</a> expenditure. </p>

<p>The unit will not follow the supposed orders you have entered.
If the power does order the unit to perform an order matching
your supposed order for it, then your own unit orders which rely
on it occurring will not happen. If the power gives a different
order for the unit to perform, then your own unit orders which
relied on the supposed order will fail, and default to <a
href="#Hold Order">Hold</a>s. All of this can only be found out
during the <a href="#9. Movement and Conflict Phase">Movement and
Conflict Phase</a> when orders from all the powers have been put
together. </p>

<p>Making a supposed order for another powers unit is just the
same as setting an order for one of your own units. Drag the
units counter with the left mouse button to a destination,
possibly choose an order if there are multiple legal orders. </p>

<p>You will see the description of the order under the <em>Other
power orders</em> section along the left side of the screen. </p>

<h3><a name="Expenditures">Expenditures</a></h3>

<p>If the <a href="#Advanced Rules">Advanced Rules</a> was

Expenditures. </p>

<p>Any number of expenditures may be chosen, though each has a
cost. Expenditures are carried out during the <a
href="#7. Ducat Expenditure Phase">Ducat Expenditure Phase</a>,
with the exception of assassination attempts which are carried
out during the <a href="#8. Assassination Phase">Assassination
Phase</a>. </p>

<p>Expenditures are resolved in the order which they are written,
so it can be important to order then in the most effective way. </p>

<p>Expenditures are shown along the left edge of the screen under
the <em>Expenditures</em> heading. </p>

<p>Associated with each expenditure you will see a number of
controls. The first will delete it. The next two move the
expenditure up or down in the list, so it is earlier or later in
the order in which expenditures are carried out. The final two
change the amount of ducats that are spent on the expenditure.
Bribes may be negated through <a
href="#(F) Counter-Bribe Expenditure">counter bribes</a>, so it
may be wise to spend more the minimum cost to ignore the effects
of any counter bribes. </p>

<p>Expenditures are entered in a similar fashion to orders, and
you will often see both orders and expenditures listed as legal
choices after dropping a counter when wishing to define a order. </p>

generated from controlled provinces, sea areas, cities and
variable power and city income, at the start of every Spring
turn. Ducats may also be transferred to another power. </p>

<p>Ducats can be used for bribing other powers, upkeep and new

<p>Assassination attempts may be made on other powers. If
successful, the powers military units become temporarily
paralysed, rebellions appear in their provinces. The original
player continues playing as his own successor. An assassination
attempt can only be attempted if you have an assassination unit

units remaining in the provinces are removed from the map board. </p>

<p>Checking <a name="Special Units"><strong>Special Units</strong></a>
allows one of your military units to be considered a special unit
with either improved military strength and/or improved resistance
to bribery from other powers. Special units have greater upkeep
costs than the standard Condottieri military units. </p>

<p>There are three different types of special unit; citizen
militia, elite mercenaries and elite professionals. Powers may
have access to only a subset of the types. </p>

<p>Checking <a name="Strategic Movement"><strong>Strategic
Movement</strong></a> allows each power to move any two of their
military units at the end of the turn as far as they like through
friendly provinces. </p>

<p>Checking <a name="Money Lenders"><strong>Money Lenders</strong></a>
allows powers to borrow up to 25 ducats. Failure to repay the
loan in one or two years with interest will stop the availability
of loans to the power, and they suffer the same effects as if
they had been assassinated. </p>

<p>Checking <a name="Conquering"><strong>Conquering</strong></a>
results in the home areas of a power being added to your own if
you control all of the provinces making up their home area. You
may only add new military units in a home province.</p>

<p><a name="Victory Condition"><strong>Victory Condition</strong></a>
defines the criteria of choosing which power has won the game.
This may occur at the start of each Spring turn.</p>

<p>Some phases are time limited. Normally once all powers have
indicated that they have entered all their actions for a phase,
the game moves to the next phase. For a time limited phase this
still holds true, but if all the players haven't finished after a
set duration the game moves to the next phase anyway. </p>

<h3><a name="Choose Connection">Choose Connection</a></h3>

<p>In Network games you have to choose which type of network
connection will be used to synchronise the players machines.
Machiavelli uses DirectPlay and by default supports modems,
serial cables, IPX and TCP/IP which is used by the internet. </p>

<p>The list of available connections is shown on the left,
checking one of these will allow you to enter additional criteria
for the selected connection on the right hand side of the panel. </p>

<p>IPX networks do not require any additional information as they
automatically search for games on the local network. </p>

<p>TCP/IP provides a number of options. You may search for games
on the local network, though this isn't very useful for the
internet. If you know the address, eg 127.0.0.1, or name of a
machine, eg scooby.net, of the server machine you wish to connect
to you may enter that. The past server addresses you have
connected to are also available if you often connect to the same
server. </p>

<p>Note that for some internet dial up accounts your internet
machine address may change each time you connect to the internet.
If this is the case either start new games from a machine with a
fixed address, or you may find out your machines current address
by using the &quot;winipcfg&quot; Windows command from the Run
entry of the Windows Start menu before running Machiavelli. You
will need some means of communicating this to the players who
wish to join the new game. </p>

<h3><a name="Choose Sessions">Choose Sessions</a></h3>

<p>Finally when joining a network game you will be shown a list
of games found using the selected connection. Select one of these
and click Finish to start playing. </p>

<p>For each available game you will be shown the title of the
game and the number of players currently joined.</p>

The contents of panels automatically updates to reflect the changing state
of the game.</p>
