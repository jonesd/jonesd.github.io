    <h1>Source Documenter</h1> This is an alternative implementation
    of the DocumentationManager class that comes with Dolphin
    Smalltalk and enables the generation of HTML documentation for a
    class.<p>

The SourceDocumenter package includes a number of advantages over the
DocumentationManager; find Class and methods references in Comments,
shows method argument names, can generate documentation for multiple
packages and classes, includes summary pages for the contents of
packages, class categories and protocols.<p>

There is still some work that I would like to do on it; support
classes that only differ in case, improve generation performance,
better formatting of produced pages, support css, tidy up the code,
generate to a single file rather than one file per class, optionally
don't overwrite index.html, include dialog box to define and run the
documenter.<p>

<a href="SourceDocumenter-1_1.pac">SourceDocumenter-1_1.pac</a> - 1.1
(16-Mar-2003) Includes missing HtmlWriteStream class from previous
release. Many thanks to Diego Coronel for spotting the mistake and
sending in a suitable implementation. Cheers.<p>
