<P>Originally I had planned for Astrophel a far more advanced, and expanded scenario to follow trynth. But with its complexity and general apathy for strategy games among archimedes owners that has only reached an early demonstration, and a lot of scribbled concepts.</P>

<P>Trynth wise I have solid plans for Trynth 2. Features such as:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Specialist programming language to allow easy design of computer players.
<LI>Genetic Programming system, for automatic creation of players.
<LI>Alliance system, at last.
<LI>Split "resources" into Resources, and Factories. Allow these to be moved
    between planets.
<LI>Possibly a real time, rather than turn based system.
<LI>Far more responsive system.
</UL>

<P>If you have any comments on what you would like to see then please get in contact. If you have written a strategy game for the arch then I would love to see it.</P>
