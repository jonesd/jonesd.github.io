# Resume - David Jones

[http://www.dgjones.info](http://www.dgjones.info)  [david@dgjones.info](mailto:david@dgjones.info)

Software developer with 20 years of commercial experience working on products and custom development projects. I have been in team lead, technical lead, architect, and coaching roles, in addition to daily coding.

My preference is to be a member of a small development team, who are collectively responsible for all phases of development and delivery. I like the greater involvement of users found in product development. Where possible I aim for automating as much as possible, including testing and delivery. Advocate for agile development approaches, and have worked using variations of XP since 2000.
