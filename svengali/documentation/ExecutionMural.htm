<p>The Execution Mural view displays the results collected during <a href="Executiontracer.htm">tracing</a>.

<p>This is a limited implementation of the application described in the following paper:</p>

</TABLE>

<p>The top view shows the individual activations of a traced
evaluation. Time is present on the x-axis, with each unit
corresponding to a recorded activation. Along the y-axis all of
the classes of the receivers of an activation are listed, ordered
such that a subclass will always be further down the view than
its superclass. For each activation a vertical line is drawn from
the class of the sender, to the class of the receiver of the
activation. The sender is marked by a green point. The connecting
line is coloured depending on the <i>plane</i> which the activation has been associated with. The associated is defined by the <a href="ExecutionHighlights.htm">Highlights</a> dialog, available from the <i>View/Highlights</i> menu item, and is based on the selector of the activated method. By default a method is associated with the empty plane and shown in white.</p>

<p>The currently selected activation is shown with a dotted
orange column. The selection may be changed with the cursor keys,
with return opening a browser onto the method of the activation.</p>

<p>The status view situated in the middle of the shell shows
details of the selected activation. The first two items are the
class of the sender followed by the class of the receiving
object. The third item is the method of the activation.</p>

<p>The lower view presents all of the activations in a similar
form to the top view but compressed to fit within the visible
extent of the pane. It can be used for navigation, by selecting
the area shown in the top pane. It is also useful for
highlighting the repeating patterns of activations as well as the
separate computation sub-stages of the whole trace.</p>

<p>One useful feature is the <a href="ExecutionStatistics.htm">Execution Statistics</a> view available from the <i>View/Statistics</i> menu item. This lists the total number of method activations grouped by class, method and selector. It can be useful for specifying plane <a href="ExecutionHighlights.htm">highlights</a>.</p>
